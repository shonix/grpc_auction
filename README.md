Write a 2-page report (if necessary you can go up to 3 pages)
containing the following structure (exactly create four sections as
below):

- Introduction. A short introduction to what you have done.

- Architecture. A description of the architecture of the system and
  its protocols (behaviour), including any protocols used internally
  between nodes of the system.

- Correctness 1. Argue whether your implementation satisfies
  linearisability or sequential consistency. In order to do so, first,
  you must state precisely what such property is.

- Correctness 2. An argument that your protocol is correct in the
  absence and the presence of failures.
